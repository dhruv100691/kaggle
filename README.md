Two Sigma: Using News to Predict Stock Movements
------------------------------------------------

This code contains my initial data analysis for the provided market and news data in the two sigma stock predictaion challenge from news data.
In the analysis I have tried to extract the trend in the opening and closing prices of a single company, along with a general trend observed in the market data from 2008-2017.
This helps to eliminate some of the outliers such as the sharp price changes during the 2009 recession period or data issues.
The notebook also carries out analysis on the news data and hot it correlates to the open and closing prices of the stocks of a goven company. 
The code cannot be run on a local machine , since the notebooks for the competition could only be run in a kaggle kernel.
